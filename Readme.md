# Software Testing and End-to-End Testing with Cypress

## 1. Introduction to Software Testing

### What is Software Testing?

Software Testing is a method to assess the functionality of the software
program. The process checks whether the actual software matches the expected
requirements and ensures the software is bug-free. The purpose of software
testing is to identify the errors, faults, or missing requirements in contrast
to actual requirements. It mainly aims at measuring the specification,
functionality, and performance of a software program or application.

Software testing can be divided into two steps:

- **Verification:** It refers to the set of tasks that ensure that the software
  correctly implements a specific function. It means “Are we building the
  product right?”.
- **Validation:** It refers to a different set of tasks that ensure that the
  software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements. It means
  “Are we building the right product?”.

### Need for Software Testing

Software bugs can cause potential monetary and human loss. There are many
examples in history that clearly depicts that without the testing phase in
software development lot of damage was incurred. Below are some examples:

- **1994:** China Airlines Airbus A300 crashed due to a software bug killing 264
  people.
- **1996:** A software bug caused U.S. bank accounts of 823 customers to be
  credited with 920 million US dollars.
- **2015:** A software bug in fighter plan F-35 resulted in making it unable to
  detect targets correctly.

### Why is Software Testing Important?

Software testing is crucial for several reasons:

- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the software meets the required quality
  standards.
- **Bug Detection:** Identifies and fixes bugs before the software is released.
- **User Satisfaction:** Ensures a smooth and error-free user experience.
- **Saves time and money:** After the application is launched it will be very
  difficult to trace and resolve the issues, as performing this activity will
  incur more costs and time. Thus, it is better to conduct software testing at
  regular intervals during software development.

### Types of Software Testing

There are several types of software testing, including:

- **Manual testing:** It includes testing software manually, i.e., without using
  any automation tool or script. In this type, the tester takes over the role of
  an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behavior or bug.
  There are different stages for manual testing such as unit testing,
  integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Testers use
  test plans, test cases, or test scenarios to test software to ensure the
  completeness of testing. Manual testing also includes exploratory testing, as
  testers explore the software to identify errors in it.

- **Automation testing:** It is also known as Test Automation, is when the
  tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product. This
  process involves the automation of a manual process. Automation Testing is
  used to re-run the test scenarios quickly and repeatedly, that were performed
  manually in manual testing. Various types of functional testing are Unit
  testing, Integration testing, System testing, Smoke testing, and so on.

### Several types of software automation testing

- **Unit Testing:** Unit testing involves testing individual components or units
  of code in isolation. It is typically done by developers and focuses on
  ensuring that each unit of code works as expected.
- **Integration Testing:** Integration testing involves testing the interaction
  between different units or components of the software. It ensures that the
  integrated components work together as expected.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** End-to-End testing involves testing the entire
  application flow from start to finish. It simulates real user scenarios and
  ensures that the application works as expected in a real-world environment.

### The Importance of Writing Tests as a Developer

As a developer, writing tests is essential for:

- **Code Reliability:** Ensures that your code works as expected.
- **Refactoring Confidence:** Allows you to refactor code with confidence,
  knowing that tests will catch any regressions.
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as documentation for how the code is supposed
  to work.
- **Collaboration:** Helps other developers understand the expected behavior of
  the code.

---

## 2. Comparing Software with and without Tests

### Benefits of Tested Software

- **Higher Quality:** Tested software is more likely to be free of bugs and
  errors.
- **Better Maintainability:** Tests make it easier to maintain and update the
  software.
- **Faster Development:** Automated tests can speed up the development process
  by catching issues early.
- **security:** Security testing is a type of software testing that is focused
  on testing the application for security vulnerabilities from internal or
  external sources.

### Risks of Untested Software

- **Increased Bugs:** Untested software is more likely to have undetected bugs.
- **Higher Costs:** Fixing bugs after release is more expensive than catching
  them early.
- **Poor User Experience:** Untested software can lead to a poor user
  experience, resulting in lost customers.

## 3. Deep Dive into End-to-End (E2E) Testing

#### **1. What is being tested?**

End-to-End (E2E) testing focuses on testing the **entire application flow** from
start to finish. It ensures that all integrated components of the application
work together as expected in real-world scenarios. This includes:

- User interfaces (UI)
- APIs and backend services
- Databases and external integrations
- Business logic and workflows

For example, in an e-commerce application, E2E testing would simulate a user
browsing products, adding items to the cart, proceeding to checkout, and
completing the purchase.

---

#### **2. Who will perform the testing?**

E2E testing is typically performed by:

- **QA Engineers:** Responsible for designing and executing test cases.
- **Developers:** Write automated E2E tests as part of the development process.
- **End Users:** In some cases, real users participate in beta testing to
  provide feedback.
- **DevOps Engineers:** Ensure E2E tests are integrated into CI/CD pipelines for
  automated execution.

---

#### **3. Where will the testing be conducted?**

E2E testing is conducted in environments that closely mimic the production
environment, such as:

- **Staging Environment:** A replica of the production environment where tests
  are run before deployment.
- **Production Environment:** In some cases, tests are run in production to
  validate real-world behavior
- **Local Development Environment:** For initial testing during development,
  though this is less common for full E2E testing.

---

#### **4. Why is End-to-End testing necessary?**

E2E testing is necessary because:

- **Real-World Scenarios:** It simulates real user interactions and scenarios.
- **Bug Detection:** It helps identify issues that may not be caught by unit or
  integration tests.
- **Ensures Application Integrity:** Verifies that all components work together
  as expected.
- **Improves Confidence:** Provides confidence that the application is ready for
  release.
- **Reduces Production Issues:** Catches critical bugs before they reach end
  users.

---

#### **6. How is End-to-End testing performed?**

E2E testing is performed using the following steps:

- **Define Test Scenarios:** Identify key user workflows to test (e.g., login,
  checkout, etc.).
- **Set Up the Test Environment:** Configure an environment that mimics
  production.
- **Write Test Cases:** Create manual or automated test scripts for each
  scenario.
- **Execute Tests:** Run the tests manually or using automation tools like
  Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright.
- **Mock External Dependencies:** Use tools to mock APIs, databases, or
  third-party services if needed.
- **Validate Results:** Compare the actual outcomes with expected results.
- **Report and Fix Bugs:** Document any issues and work with developers to
  resolve them.
- **Automate Tests:** Integrate E2E tests into CI/CD pipelines for continuous
  validation.

### Introduction to Cypress

Cypress is a modern, JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that is
designed to make testing easier and more reliable. It is built on top of Mocha
and Chai and provides a rich set of features for writing and running tests.

### Why Use Cypress?

- **Fast Execution:** Cypress tests run directly in the browser, making them
  faster than other testing tools.
- **Easy Setup:** Cypress is easy to set up and requires minimal configuration.
- **Real-Time Reloads:** Cypress provides real-time reloads, allowing you to see
  the results of your tests as you write them.
- **Automatic Waiting:** Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear and
  actions to complete, reducing the need for manual waits.

### Deep Dive into Cypress

Cypress is built on a unique architecture that allows it to run tests directly
in the browser. This architecture provides several advantages, including faster
execution, real-time reloads, and automatic waiting. Cypress also provides a
rich set of APIs for interacting with the DOM, making it easy to write tests
that simulate real user interactions.

## 5. Writing End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Simple E2E Test Example

```javascript
describe("My First Test", () => {
  it("Visits the page", () => {
    cy.visit("https://example.cypress.io");
    cy.contains("type").click();
    cy.get(".action-email")
      .type("fake@email.com")
      .should("have.value", "fake@email.com");
  });
});
```

# Testing a User Table with Cypress

In this example, we’ll write a Cypress test for a page that fetches a list of
users from a backend API and displays them in a table. The test will verify that
the data is correctly fetched and rendered in the table.

---

## Scenario

- The page has a table to display user data.
- The user data is fetched from a backend API (e.g., `GET /api/users`).
- The table should display the following columns: `ID`, `Name`, `Email`, and
  `Role`.

---

## Backend API Response Example

The backend API returns a JSON response like this:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "role": "Admin" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com", "role": "User" }
]
```

---

## HTML Table Structure

The table in the page might look like this:

```html
<table id="user-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
      <th>Role</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <!-- Rows will be dynamically populated by JavaScript -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

---

## Cypress Test Example

### Test Steps:

1. Visit the page containing the user table.
2. Mock the backend API response to return a list of users.
3. Verify that the table is populated with the correct data.

### Code:

```javascript
describe("User Table Test", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock the backend API response
    cy.intercept("GET", "/api/users", {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: [
        { id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", role: "Admin" },
        { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", email: "jane@example.com", role: "User" },
      ],
    }).as("getUsers");

    // Visit the page
    cy.visit("/user-table-page");
  });

  it("should display the user table with correct data", () => {
    // Wait for the API call to complete
    cy.wait("@getUsers");

    // Verify the table headers
    cy.get("#user-table thead th").should("contain", "ID");
    cy.get("#user-table thead th").should("contain", "Name");
    cy.get("#user-table thead th").should("contain", "Email");
    cy.get("#user-table thead th").should("contain", "Role");

    // Verify the table rows
    cy.get("#user-table tbody tr").should("have.length", 2);

    // Verify the first row
    cy.get("#user-table tbody tr")
      .eq(0)
      .within(() => {
        cy.get("td").eq(0).should("contain", "1");
        cy.get("td").eq(1).should("contain", "John Doe");
        cy.get("td").eq(2).should("contain", "john@example.com");
        cy.get("td").eq(3).should("contain", "Admin");
      });

    // Verify the second row
    cy.get("#user-table tbody tr")
      .eq(1)
      .within(() => {
        cy.get("td").eq(0).should("contain", "2");
        cy.get("td").eq(1).should("contain", "Jane Smith");
        cy.get("td").eq(2).should("contain", "jane@example.com");
        cy.get("td").eq(3).should("contain", "User");
      });
  });
});
```

---

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Mocking the API Response:**

   - `cy.intercept` is used to mock the `GET /api/users` request and return a
     predefined response.
   - The `as('getUsers')` command assigns an alias to the intercepted request,
     which can be used later to wait for the request to complete.

2. **Visiting the Page:**

   - `cy.visit('/user-table-page')` navigates to the page containing the user
     table.

3. **Waiting for the API Call:**

   - `cy.wait('@getUsers')` waits for the mocked API request to complete before
     proceeding with the test.

4. **Verifying the Table:**
   - The test checks that the table headers (`ID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Role`) are
     correctly displayed.
   - It verifies that the table has the correct number of rows (2 in this case).
   - For each row, it checks that the data matches the mocked API response.

---

## Advanced Example: Dynamic Data and Pagination

If the table supports pagination and dynamically fetches data, you can extend
the test to verify pagination behavior.

### Mocking Paginated Data:

```javascript
cy.intercept("GET", "/api/users?page=1", {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: [
    { id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", role: "Admin" },
    { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", email: "jane@example.com", role: "User" },
  ],
}).as("getPage1");

cy.intercept("GET", "/api/users?page=2", {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: [
    { id: 3, name: "Alice Johnson", email: "alice@example.com", role: "User" },
    { id: 4, name: "Bob Brown", email: "bob@example.com", role: "Admin" },
  ],
}).as("getPage2");
```

### Testing Pagination:

```javascript
it("should display paginated user data", () => {
  // Wait for the first page to load
  cy.wait("@getPage1");

  // Verify the first page data
  cy.get("#user-table tbody tr").should("have.length", 2);
  cy.get("#user-table tbody tr")
    .eq(0)
    .within(() => {
      cy.get("td").eq(1).should("contain", "John Doe");
    });

  // Click the "Next" button
  cy.get("#next-page-button").click();

  // Wait for the second page to load
  cy.wait("@getPage2");

  // Verify the second page data
  cy.get("#user-table tbody tr").should("have.length", 2);
  cy.get("#user-table tbody tr")
    .eq(0)
    .within(() => {
      cy.get("td").eq(1).should("contain", "Alice Johnson");
    });
});
```

## Best Practices for Testing Tables with Cypress

**Use Aliases for API Requests:**

- Assign aliases to intercepted requests to make the test more readable and
  maintainable.

**Verify Table Structure:**

- Check that the table headers and rows are correctly rendered.

**Test Edge Cases:**

- Test scenarios like empty tables, loading states, and error handling.

**Use `within` for Row Verification:**

- Use `cy.within()` to scope assertions to a specific row or cell.

**Mock Realistic Data:**

- Use realistic data in your mocks to ensure the test reflects real-world usage.

---

This example demonstrates how to test a user table in Cypress, including mocking
API responses, verifying table data, and handling pagination. By following these
practices, you can ensure that your table components work as expected in your
application.

### For Writing E2E Tests

- **Keep Tests Isolated:** Ensure that each test is independent and does not
  rely on the state of other tests.
- **Use Descriptive Test Names:** Use descriptive names for your tests to make
  it clear what they are testing.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Values:** Avoid hardcoding values in your tests; use
  variables or configuration files instead.
- **Use Page Objects:** Use page objects to encapsulate the logic for
  interacting with specific pages or components.
